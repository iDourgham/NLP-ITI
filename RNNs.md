# What I Know About RNNs

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to handle **sequential data**. They differ from traditional (feedforward) neural networks in several key ways:

## Key Differences from Traditional Neural Networks

* **Variable-Length Input Handling**: Unlike standard neural networks which require fixed-size inputs and outputs, RNNs can handle sequences of **variable lengths**.
* **Memory of Previous Inputs**: RNNs maintain a **hidden state** that acts as a memory, allowing them to retain information about **previous steps in the sequence**. This is critical for understanding context and dependencies across time steps.

## Structure of an RNN

* RNNs can be **unfolded** across time steps. This means that the same set of weights is **repeated** at each time step of the input sequence.
* This recurrent structure enables sequence modeling but also introduces two major challenges:

### Problems in RNNs

1. **Vanishing Gradient**: When training long sequences, gradients can become very small, effectively preventing the network from learning long-range dependencies.
2. **Exploding Gradient**: Conversely, gradients can grow too large, causing instability during training.

Both issues stem from the repeated multiplication of gradients through time, due to the **shared weights** across time steps.

## Common RNN Architectures

RNNs come in several variants, depending on the type of input and output:

| Type                              | Description                                | Example                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **One-to-One**                    | Standard NN                                | Image classification           |
| **One-to-Many**                   | One input, sequence output                 | Image captioning               |
| **Many-to-One**                   | Sequence input, one output                 | Sentiment analysis             |
| **Many-to-Many (equal length)**   | Sequence in, sequence out                  | Named Entity Recognition (NER) |
| **Many-to-Many (unequal length)** | Sequence in, different length sequence out | Machine translation            |

## LSTM: 

Due to the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, advanced variants like **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks were introduced. LSTMs are designed to **better preserve long-range dependencies** by using gates (input, output, forget) to regulate the flow of information through the network.
