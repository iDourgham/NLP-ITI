# ITI - Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course

Welcome to the **NLP Course** repository! This repository contains materials, code, and examples from the NLP course. It includes various techniques and methods used in Natural Language Processing, from basic text preprocessing to advanced model training. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your NLP knowledge, this course will guide you through practical applications and key concepts.

## Course Overview

In this course, we cover the following topics:

1. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Tokenization
   * Lemmatization and stemming
   * Stop words removal
   * Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.)

2. **Supervised Learning for NLP**

   * Sentiment Analysis
   * Text Classification
   * Named Entity Recognition (NER)

3. **Deep Learning for NLP**

   * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
   * Transformer models (BERT, GPT)

4. **Applications of NLP**

   * Chatbots and Conversational AI
   * Text Summarization
   * Translation and Language Generation

The code includes tutorials, exercises, and solutions for different NLP tasks using popular libraries like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **NLTK**, **spaCy**, and **transformers**.
