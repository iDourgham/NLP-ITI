# Encoder–Decoder Architectures in Neural Networks

## Overview

The **encoder–decoder architecture** is widely used in tasks involving **sequence-to-sequence learning**, such as **machine translation**, **text summarization**, and **speech recognition**.

### Basic Concept

* The **encoder** reads and processes the input sequence (e.g., a sentence in the source language).
* It transforms this sequence into an **internal fixed-length vector representation** (also called the *context vector*).
* The **decoder** then uses this vector to generate the output sequence (e.g., a translated sentence in the target language).

Both the encoder and decoder are typically implemented using RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs.

## Limitations of the Basic Encoder–Decoder

Encoding an entire input sequence into a **single fixed-length vector** can be problematic, especially when:

* Input sequences are **long** or contain complex structure.
* Important information gets **compressed or lost** in the vector.
* The decoder lacks **flexibility** in focusing on specific parts of the input.

This becomes a bottleneck for performance in real-world translation tasks.

## Attention Mechanism: A Key Improvement

To address the fixed-vector bottleneck, researchers introduced the **attention mechanism**. It enhances the encoder–decoder model by allowing the decoder to **access different parts of the input dynamically**.

### How Attention Works

* The encoder processes the input sequence into a **sequence of vectors**, one per time step (rather than a single vector).
* At each decoding step, the decoder:

  * Computes **attention weights** over the encoder’s output vectors.
  * Forms a **context vector** as a weighted sum of these outputs.
  * Uses the context vector to predict the next word in the target sequence.

This process is **soft**, meaning it's fully differentiable and can be trained end-to-end with gradient descent.

## Benefits of Attention

* Frees the model from compressing all source information into one vector.
* Allows the decoder to **"focus"** on the most relevant parts of the input at each output step.
* Improves translation quality, especially for **longer and more complex sentences**.

### Summary of Key Differences

| Feature                 | Basic Encoder–Decoder      | Attention-Based Encoder–Decoder |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Input Encoding          | Single fixed-length vector | Sequence of vectors             |
| Decoder Input           | Static context vector      | Dynamic context vector per step |
| Handling Long Sequences | Poor                       | Significantly better            |
| Interpretability        | Low                        | High (can visualize attention)  |
